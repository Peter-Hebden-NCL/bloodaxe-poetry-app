She was able to publish some work during the war, but in 1946 she again came under attack, this time from Zhdanov, who denounced her with Pasternak and others for trying to &lsquo;poison the minds&rsquo; of Soviet youth.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese were attacks on her <em>published<\/em> work.

Acknowledged since the 1930s as a major figure in Modernist poetry, first by Pound and Zukofsky and later by younger writers, the Northumbrian master poet had to wait over 30 years before his genius was finally recognised in Britain - in 1966, with the publication of <em>Briggflatts,<\/em> which Cyril Connolly called &#39;the finest long poem to have been published in England since T.S. Eliot&#39;s <em>Four Quartets<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBorn in Northumberland in 1900, Bunting lived in Paris in the 20s, where Ezra Pound rescued him from jail and fixed him up with a job on the <em>Transatlantic Review<\/em>. He later followed Pound to Italy - giving up his job to Hemingway - where Yeats knew him as &#39;one of Pound&#39;s more savage disciples&#39;. For the next 30 years he led a sometimes wild and always varied life - in Italy, England, Berlin, Tenerife, America and Persia - as a struggling, penniless writer, a music critic, sea captain, RAF officer, <em>Times<\/em> correspondent and Chief of Political Intelligence in Tehran. During these years he built up a reputation in America as the best English poet of his generation, at the same time as his poetry was neglected in Britain. In 1954 he returned to Northumberland, and worked for several years as a sub-editor on the Newcastle <em>Evening Chronicle<\/em>. It was not until the publication of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> that his genius was finally recognised. He died in 1985.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Complete Poems<\/em> (2000) was reissued by Bloodaxe for Bunting&#39;s centenary and includes his original <em>Collected Poems<\/em> alongside the posthumous <em>Uncollected Poems<\/em>. It also contains a new introduction by Richard Caddel.&nbsp;The separate Bloodaxe edition of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> (2009) includes a CD with an audio recording Bunting made of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> in 1967 and a DVD of Peter Bell&rsquo;s 1982 film portrait of Bunting. As well as his own notes to the poem, the book includes his seminal essay on sound and meaning in poetry, &lsquo;The Poet&rsquo;s Point of View&rsquo; (1966). Released in June 2016 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first publication of <em>Briggflatts<\/em>, the enhanced ebook with audio of <em>Complete Poems<\/em> includes audio files of all of Bunting&#39;s major works, while the enhanced ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> includes audio files of two different readings by Bunting (1967 and 1977) together with a video of Peter Bell&#39;s film portrait.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following books are useful guides to Bunting&#39;s life and work: Keith Aldritt:&nbsp;<em>The Poet as Spy: The Life and Wild Times of Basil Bunting<\/em>&nbsp;(Aurum Press, 1999); Richard Caddel &amp; Anthony Flowers:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: A Northern Life<\/em>&nbsp;(Newcastle Libraries and Information Service \/ Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1997); Victoria Forde:&nbsp;<em>The Poetry of Basil Bunting<\/em>&nbsp;(Bloodaxe Books, 1991); Peter Makin:&nbsp;<em>Bunting: The Shaping of his Verse<\/em>&nbsp;(Clarendon Press, 1992); Peter Quartermain:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: Poet of the North<\/em>&nbsp;(Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1990); Richard Burton: <em>A Strong Song Tows Us: The Life of Basil Bunting<\/em> (2013). Selections of Bunting&#39;s prose are available in&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting on Poetry<\/em>, ed. Peter Makin (John Hopkins University Press, 2000).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloodaxe first published Bunting in 1980 when one of the earliest titles was an LP record of Bunting reading&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts<\/em>&nbsp;in 1977 accompanied in one section of the poem by a Scarlatti sonata. That recording is now being reissued on the ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts<\/em>, together with the 1967 audio recording released on cassette by Bloodaxe in 2000 and then included on the CD included with the 2007 <em>Briggflatts<\/em> edition. in 1991 Bloodaxe published the first major critical study of Bunting&#39;s work by Sister Victoria Forde. During his last years, Bunting lived at Tarset in Northumberland, just down the valley from where Bloodaxe Books was located for 15 years. Bloodaxe is named after Eric Bloodaxe, the last king of independent Northumbria, who features in&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts<\/em>&nbsp;as Bunting&#39;s opposite persona to the Cuthbert side of his Northumbrian identity.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloodaxe has sublicensed a critical edition of Bunting&rsquo;s complete poetry, <em>The Poems<\/em>, edited by Don Share (2016), to Faber &amp; Faber.

His later poetry is more personal, open and relaxed, often reflecting his broad interests: travel, music, painting, archaeology and natural sciences.<\/p> <p> \tHe was Scandinavia&rsquo;s best-known and most influential contemporary poet. His books sell thousands of copies in Sweden, and his work has been translated into over 50 languages, with substantial or complete editions of his work published in over 20 languages. <\/p> <p> \tTranstr&ouml;mer started writing poetry while at the oppressive S&ouml;dra Latin Grammar School (its atmosphere caught by Ingmar Bergman in Alf Sj&ouml;berg&rsquo;s <em>Frenzy<\/em>, which was filmed there, the young Tomas amongst the pupils). But he was devouring books on all subjects, especially geography, with daily visits to the local library, where he worked his way through most of the non-fiction shelves. However, this bookish adolescence was shadowed by the war, by his parents&rsquo; divorce and the absence of his father, and at 15 he experienced a winter of psychological crisis. He published his first collection, <em>17 Poems<\/em>, in 1954, at the age of 23.<\/p> <p> \tAfter studying psychology at the University of Stockholm, he worked at its Psychotechnological Institute, and in 1960 became a psychologist at Roxtuna, a young offenders institution. From the mid-1960s he divided his time between his writing and his work as a psychologist, and in 1965 moved with his family to V&auml;ster&aring;s, where he spent the rest of his working life. In 1990, a year after the publication of his tenth book of poems, Transtr&ouml;mer suffered a stroke, which deprived him of most of his speech and partly inhibited movement on his right-hand side. Swedish composers have since written several left-hand piano pieces especially for him to play.<\/p> <p> \tAfter his stroke, he published a short book of &#39;autobiographical chapters&#39;, <em>Memories Look at Me<\/em> (1993) and a new collection, <em>The Sad Gondola <\/em> (1996), both included in Robin Fulton&rsquo;s translation of his Bloodaxe <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> (1997). In 2004 he published <em>The Great Enigma<\/em>, a slim volume containing five short poems and a group of 45 even smaller haiku-type poems. These were added to the <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> to form Transtr&ouml;mer&rsquo;s first collected edition to appear in the States, licensed by Bloodaxe Books to New Directions in 2006 under the title <em>The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems.<\/em> That edition was published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK as the latest revised and expanded edition of <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> in 2010.&nbsp;<\/p> <p> \tTranstr&ouml;mer also translated other poets into Swedish, including Robert Bly and Hungary&rsquo;s J&aacute;nos Pilinszky. Before winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2011, he had won many other international awards for his poetry, including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in the US, the Bonner Award for Poetry, Germany&rsquo;s Petrarch Prize, the Bellman Prize, the Swedish Academy&rsquo;s Nordic Prize, and the August Prize. In 1997 the city of V&auml;ster&aring;s established a special Transtr&ouml;mer Prize. In 2007, he received a special Lifetime Recognition Award given by the trustees of the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry, which also awards the annual Griffin Poetry Prize.<\/p> <p> \tHis correspondence with Robert Bly was published in Sweden in 2001, and in 2013 an English translation, <em>Airmail: The Letters of Robert Bly and Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer<\/em>, was published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK and by Graywolf Press in the US.<\/p>","themes":"nature,music,travel,night","user_themes":""}, {"id_number":"9","id_name":"mark-waldron","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Waldron","author_link":"http:\/\/www.bloodaxebooks.com\/ecs\/category\/mark-waldron","poem_title":"All My Poems Are Advertisements for Me","epigraph_text":null,"poem_text":"<p>When I was young there was nothing exactly stupid<\/p><p>about the world.

Born in 1958 in Birmingham, he grew up in Handsworth, where he was sent to an approved school for being uncontrollable, rebellious and &lsquo;a born failure&rsquo;, ending up in jail for burglary and affray.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter prison he turned from crime to music and poetry. In 1989 he was nominated for Oxford Professor of Poetry, and has since received honorary doctorates from several English universities, but famously refused to accept a nomination for an OBE in 2003. He was voted Britain&#39;s third favourite poet of all time (after T.S. Eliot and John Donne) in a BBC poll in 2009. In 2011 he was poet-in-residence at Keats House in 2011, and then made a radical career change by taking up his first ever academic position as a chair in Creative Writing at Brunel University in West London.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe has appeared in a number of television programmes, including <em>Eastenders, The Bill, Live and Kicking, Blue Peter<\/em> and <em>Wise Up<\/em>, and played Gower in a BBC Radio 3 production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Pericles<\/em> in 2005.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBest known for his performance poetry with a political edge for adults &ndash; and his poetry with attitude for children &ndash; he has his own rap\/reggae band.

He was the first person to record with the Wailers after the death of Bob Marley, in a musical tribute to Nelson Mandela, which Mandela heard while in prison on Robben Island. Their later meetings led to Zephaniah working with children in South African townships and hosting the President&rsquo;s Two Nations Concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1996.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis first book of poems, <em>Pen Rhythm<\/em>, was produced in 1980 by a small East London publishing cooperative, Page One Books. His second collection, <em>The Dread Affair<\/em>, was published by Hutchinson&rsquo;s short-lived Arena imprint in 1985. He has since published three collections with Bloodaxe, <em>City Psalms<\/em> (1992), <em>Propa Propaganda<\/em> (1996) and <em>Too Black Too Strong<\/em> (2001), the latter including poems written while working with Michael Mansfield QC and other Tooks barristers on the Stephen Lawrence case.

He was called &lsquo;the godfather of the new poetry&rsquo; because his politically edgy, cuttingly colloquial, muscular poetry influenced a whole generation of younger British poets, from Simon Armitage to Carol Ann Duffy.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKen Smith was born in Rudston, East Yorkshire, the son of an itinerant farm labourer. He worked in Britain and America as a teacher, freelance writer, barman, magazine editor, potato picker, BBC reader and creative writing fellow, and was writer-in-residence at Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1985-87. He received America&rsquo;s highly prestigious Lannan Literary Award for Poetry in 1997, and a Cholmondeley Award in 1998.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKen Smith was the first poet to be published by Bloodaxe, with his pamphlet <i>Tristan Crazy<\/i> in 1978. Smith&rsquo;s first book, <i>The Pity<\/i>, was published by Jonathan Cape in 1967, and his second, <i>Work, distances\/poems<\/i>, by Swallow Press, Chicago, in 1972. His early books span a transition from his preoccupation with land and myth (when he lived in Yorkshire, Devon and America) to his later engagement with urban Britain and the politics of radical disaffection (when he lived in East London). <i>The Poet Reclining: Selected Poems 1962-1980<\/i> (Bloodaxe, 1982; reissued 1989) covers the first half of his writing career.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1986 Ken Smith&rsquo;s collection <i>Terra<\/i> was shortlisted for the Whitbread Award. In 1987 Bloodaxe published his collected prose, <i>A Book of Chinese Whispers<\/i>. Four of his collections, <i>Terra<\/i> (1986), <i>Wormwood<\/i> (1987), <i>The heart, the border<\/i> (1990) and <i>Tender to the Queen of Spain<\/i> (1993), were Poetry Book Society Recommendations. His last separate collection, <i>Wild Root<\/i> (1998), a Poetry Book Society Choice, was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize.

This was published in paperback by Mandarin in 1990.

It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck themselves.

Due to her dissident connections she was expelled but graduated as a distance student in Romance and Germanic philology. She has worked for the cultural weekly <em>Sirp<\/em> (Sickle) and as the Secretary-General of the Estonian National Commission for UNESCO from 1992 to 2008, and is currently an editor for the literary journal <em>Looming <\/em>(Creation).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n Following the restoration of Estonian independence, Kareva&rsquo;s collection <em>In Place of the World<\/em> received the national cultural prize in 1993.

She has also translated poetry (Anna Akhmatova, Emily Bront&euml;, Emily Dickinson, Kabir, Rumi) and plays, essays and prose (W.H. Auden, Samuel Beckett, Joseph Brodsky, Kahlil Gibran, Shakespeare).

The contemporary jazz composer and collaborator of Bj&ouml;rk and Lou Reed, Oliver Lake, has composed music based on Madzirov&#39;s poems. His work has been translated into more than thirty languages. The first translation of his poetry into English was <i>Remnants of Another Age<\/i>, translated by Peggy Reid, Graham Reid, Magdalena Horvat and Adam Reed, and published with a foreword by Carolyn Forch&eacute; by BOA Editions in the US in 2011 and by Bloodaxe Books in the UK in 2013.

He was born in Tartu in 1941, shortly after the Soviet annexation of Estonia. His mother was Estonian, and his Polish father died in a labour camp in northern Russia when Jaan was still a child. &lsquo;My childhood,&rsquo; he has said, &lsquo;passed in Tartu, a war-devastated university town. It was a time of repression, fear and poverty.&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n Jaan Kaplinski studied Romance Language and Linguistics at Tartu University and has worked as a researcher in linguistics, as a sociologist, ecologist and translator. He has lectured on the History of Western Civilisation at Tartu University and has been a student of Mahayana Buddhism and philosophies of the Far East. He has published several books of poetry and essays in Estonian, Finnish and English, and his work has been translated into Norwegian, Swedish, Latvian, Russian and Czech.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n After publishing translations of three collections with Harvill in Britain, one of these from Breitenbush and one from Copper Canyon in the US, Kaplinski published <i>Evening Brings Everything Back<\/i> with Bloodaxe Books in 2004, a book combining work from three earlier titles published in Estonia, <i>Evening brings everything back<\/i> (1984), <i>Ice and Heather<\/i> (1989) and <i>Summers and Springs<\/i> (1995). His semi-autobiographical novel, <i>The Same River<\/i>, translated by Susan Wilson, was published by Peter Owen in 2009.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n His <i>Selected Poems<\/i> (Bloodaxe Books, 2011) includes work previously unpublished in English as well as poems drawn from all four of his previous UK collections: <i>The Same Sea in Us All<\/i> (1985\/1990), <i>The Wandering Border<\/i> (1987\/1992), <i>Through the Forest<\/i> (1991\/1996) and <i>Evening Brings Everything Back<\/i> (2004). He was awarded the European Prize for Literature in 2016.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n He has translated poetry from French, English, Spanish, Chinese and Swedish (a book of poems by Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer), and travelled in many countries, including Britain, China, Turkey and parts of Russia. Awarded many prizes and honours, he is a member of several learned societies including the Universal Academy of Cultures, and has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Jaan Kaplinski was a member of the new post-Revolution Estonian parliament (Riigikogu) in 1992-95 and his essays on cultural transition and the challenges of globalisation are published across the Baltic region.

She was co-founder and President of the Civic Alliance from 1990, an independent non-political organisation that fought for freedom and democratic change. She also re-founded and became President of the Romanian PEN Club, and in 1993, under the aegis of the European Community, she created the Memorial for the Victims of Communism. In recognition of her contribution to European culture and her valiant fight for human rights, Blandiana was awarded the highest distinction of the French Republic, the L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;Honneur (2009).

She was the only one in her family of labourers to see the ocean, to go to college, or to dream of writing a book. She attended the University of Divin&oacute;polis, earning degrees in Philosophy and Religious Education, and taught in schools until 1979. From 1983 to 1988 she served as Cultural Liaison for the City of Divin&oacute;polis.<\/p>\r\n<p>A private writer and daydreamer since she was a girl, it was not until she was nearly 40 that Ad&eacute;lia Prado began to think she might be writing something worthy of being called &ldquo;literature&rdquo;, and sent a small sheaf of work off to poet and critic Affonso Romano de Sant&rsquo;Anna. Sant&rsquo;Anna, in turn, passed the poems along to Brazil&rsquo;s great modernist, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, who pronounced them &lsquo;phenomenal&rsquo;, and hand-delivered them to his editor. Drummond subsequently announced in a newspaper column that St Francis was dictating verses to a housewife in Minas Gerais, and her literary career was launched. <em>Bagagem<\/em> (Baggage), her debut collection, was released soon afterwards in 1976, followed by seven subsequent books of poetry, and seven of prose. Despite &ldquo;overnight&rdquo; and continuing success, Ad&eacute;lia Prado mainly prefers to remain out of the limelight, only very occasionally travelling to Rio or S&atilde;o Paulo to participate in literary events. And despite this relative &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; status, she is recognised as one of the most important poets in Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ad&eacute;lia Prado has been the subject of dozens of theses and dissertations, as well as a documentary film and countless articles, profiles, and interviews in newspapers, literary supplements, and popular magazines, and her work has been translated into Spanish, Italian and English. In 2006, she was a huge hit as the featured reader at FLIP (Paraty International Literary Festival). A documentary and theatrical adaptations of Ad&eacute;lia Prado&rsquo;s work have widened her readership and gained her popular acclaim. The one-woman show <em>Dona Doida: Un Interl&uacute;dio<\/em> (Mad Mrs: An Interlude) had a spectacular run in Rio de Janeiro starring Fernanda Montenegro, the grand-dame of Brazilian theatre, and toured throughout Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1998, when the National Library&rsquo;s <em>Jornal de Poesia<\/em> polled intellectuals to compile the &lsquo;List of Twenty&rsquo; foremost living poets, she was ranked fourth. Since 1996, the Instituto Moreira Salles has been producing <em>Cadernos de Literature Brasileira<\/em> &ndash; coffee-table sized retrospectives of a writer&rsquo;s work, complete with photographs, manuscript reproductions and critical essays. Among the first to be so honoured with one of these tribute volumes were Jo&atilde;o Cabral de Melo Neto and Jorge Amado. Ad&eacute;lia Prado was featured in 2000.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014 she received the Griffin Lifetime Achievement Award in Canada. In November 2014 her first UK edition, <em>The Mystical Rose: Selected Poems<\/em>, was published by Bloodaxe Books.&nbsp; This drew on on Ellen Dor&eacute; Watson&rsquo;s translations from her two US titles, <em>The Alphabet in the Park: Selected Poems<\/em> (Wesleyan University Press, 1990) and <em>Ex-Voto<\/em> (Tupelo Press, 2013).&nbsp; <em>The Mystical Rose: Selected Poems<\/em> was shortlisted for the Popescu European Poetry Translation Prize 2015 for Ellen Dor&eacute; Watson&rsquo;s translations from Brazilian Portuguese.<\/p>","themes":"","user_themes":""}, {"id_number":"414","id_name":"nia-davies","first_name":"Nia","last_name":"Davies","author_link":"https:\/\/www.bloodaxebooks.com\/ecs\/category\/nia-davies","poem_title":"About me","epigraph_text":"","poem_text":"<p style=&quot;font-family: Times; font-size: medium;&quot;>Because I was sleeping all over here,<\/p>\r\n<p style=&quot;font-family: Times; font-size: medium;&quot;>and here.
