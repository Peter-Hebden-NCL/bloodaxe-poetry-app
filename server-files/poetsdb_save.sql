She was able to publish some work during the war, but in 1946 she again came under attack, this time from Zhdanov, who denounced her with Pasternak and others for trying to &lsquo;poison the minds&rsquo; of Soviet youth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	These were attacks on her <em>published</em> work.

Acknowledged since the 1930s as a major figure in Modernist poetry, first by Pound and Zukofsky and later by younger writers, the Northumbrian master poet had to wait over 30 years before his genius was finally recognised in Britain - in 1966, with the publication of <em>Briggflatts,</em> which Cyril Connolly called &#39;the finest long poem to have been published in England since T.S. Eliot&#39;s <em>Four Quartets</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Born in Northumberland in 1900, Bunting lived in Paris in the 20s, where Ezra Pound rescued him from jail and fixed him up with a job on the <em>Transatlantic Review</em>. He later followed Pound to Italy - giving up his job to Hemingway - where Yeats knew him as &#39;one of Pound&#39;s more savage disciples&#39;. For the next 30 years he led a sometimes wild and always varied life - in Italy, England, Berlin, Tenerife, America and Persia - as a struggling, penniless writer, a music critic, sea captain, RAF officer, <em>Times</em> correspondent and Chief of Political Intelligence in Tehran. During these years he built up a reputation in America as the best English poet of his generation, at the same time as his poetry was neglected in Britain. In 1954 he returned to Northumberland, and worked for several years as a sub-editor on the Newcastle <em>Evening Chronicle</em>. It was not until the publication of <em>Briggflatts</em> that his genius was finally recognised. He died in 1985.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>Complete Poems</em> (2000) was reissued by Bloodaxe for Bunting&#39;s centenary and includes his original <em>Collected Poems</em> alongside the posthumous <em>Uncollected Poems</em>. It also contains a new introduction by Richard Caddel.&nbsp;The separate Bloodaxe edition of <em>Briggflatts</em> (2009) includes a CD with an audio recording Bunting made of <em>Briggflatts</em> in 1967 and a DVD of Peter Bell&rsquo;s 1982 film portrait of Bunting. As well as his own notes to the poem, the book includes his seminal essay on sound and meaning in poetry, &lsquo;The Poet&rsquo;s Point of View&rsquo; (1966). Released in June 2016 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first publication of <em>Briggflatts</em>, the enhanced ebook with audio of <em>Complete Poems</em> includes audio files of all of Bunting&#39;s major works, while the enhanced ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts</em> includes audio files of two different readings by Bunting (1967 and 1977) together with a video of Peter Bell&#39;s film portrait.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The following books are useful guides to Bunting&#39;s life and work: Keith Aldritt:&nbsp;<em>The Poet as Spy: The Life and Wild Times of Basil Bunting</em>&nbsp;(Aurum Press, 1999); Richard Caddel &amp; Anthony Flowers:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: A Northern Life</em>&nbsp;(Newcastle Libraries and Information Service / Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1997); Victoria Forde:&nbsp;<em>The Poetry of Basil Bunting</em>&nbsp;(Bloodaxe Books, 1991); Peter Makin:&nbsp;<em>Bunting: The Shaping of his Verse</em>&nbsp;(Clarendon Press, 1992); Peter Quartermain:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: Poet of the North</em>&nbsp;(Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1990); Richard Burton: <em>A Strong Song Tows Us: The Life of Basil Bunting</em> (2013).

Peter Makin (John Hopkins University Press, 2000).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Bloodaxe first published Bunting in 1980 when one of the earliest titles was an LP record of Bunting reading&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts</em>&nbsp;in 1977 accompanied in one section of the poem by a Scarlatti sonata. That recording is now being reissued on the ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts</em>, together with the 1967 audio recording released on cassette by Bloodaxe in 2000 and then included on the CD included with the 2007 <em>Briggflatts</em> edition. in 1991 Bloodaxe published the first major critical study of Bunting&#39;s work by Sister Victoria Forde. During his last years, Bunting lived at Tarset in Northumberland, just down the valley from where Bloodaxe Books was located for 15 years. Bloodaxe is named after Eric Bloodaxe, the last king of independent Northumbria, who features in&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts</em>&nbsp;as Bunting&#39;s opposite persona to the Cuthbert side of his Northumbrian identity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Bloodaxe has sublicensed a critical edition of Bunting&rsquo;s complete poetry, <em>The Poems</em>, edited by Don Share (2016), to Faber &amp; Faber.

But he was devouring books on all subjects, especially geography, with daily visits to the local library, where he worked his way through most of the non-fiction shelves. However, this bookish adolescence was shadowed by the war, by his parents&rsquo; divorce and the absence of his father, and at 15 he experienced a winter of psychological crisis. He published his first collection, <em>17 Poems</em>, in 1954, at the age of 23.</p> <p> 	After studying psychology at the University of Stockholm, he worked at its Psychotechnological Institute, and in 1960 became a psychologist at Roxtuna, a young offenders institution. From the mid-1960s he divided his time between his writing and his work as a psychologist, and in 1965 moved with his family to V&auml;ster&aring;s, where he spent the rest of his working life. In 1990, a year after the publication of his tenth book of poems, Transtr&ouml;mer suffered a stroke, which deprived him of most of his speech and partly inhibited movement on his right-hand side. Swedish composers have since written several left-hand piano pieces especially for him to play.</p> <p> 	After his stroke, he published a short book of &#39;autobiographical chapters&#39;, <em>Memories Look at Me</em> (1993) and a new collection, <em>The Sad Gondola </em> (1996), both included in Robin Fulton&rsquo;s translation of his Bloodaxe <em>New Collected Poems</em> (1997). In 2004 he published <em>The Great Enigma</em>, a slim volume containing five short poems and a group of 45 even smaller haiku-type poems. These were added to the <em>New Collected Poems</em> to form Transtr&ouml;mer&rsquo;s first collected edition to appear in the States, licensed by Bloodaxe Books to New Directions in 2006 under the title <em>The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems.</em> That edition was published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK as the latest revised and expanded edition of <em>New Collected Poems</em> in 2010.&nbsp;</p> <p> 	Transtr&ouml;mer also translated other poets into Swedish, including Robert Bly and Hungary&rsquo;s J&aacute;nos Pilinszky. Before winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2011, he had won many other international awards for his poetry, including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in the US, the Bonner Award for Poetry, Germany&rsquo;s Petrarch Prize, the Bellman Prize, the Swedish Academy&rsquo;s Nordic Prize, and the August Prize. In 1997 the city of V&auml;ster&aring;s established a special Transtr&ouml;mer Prize. In 2007, he received a special Lifetime Recognition Award given by the trustees of the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry, which also awards the annual Griffin Poetry Prize.</p> <p> 	His correspondence with Robert Bly was published in Sweden in 2001, and in 2013 an English translation, <em>Airmail: The Letters of Robert Bly and Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer</em>, was published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK and by Graywolf Press in the US.</p>', 'nature,music,travel,art,geography', ''),

Born in 1958 in Birmingham, he grew up in Handsworth, where he was sent to an approved school for being uncontrollable, rebellious and &lsquo;a born failure&rsquo;, ending up in jail for burglary and affray.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	After prison he turned from crime to music and poetry. In 1989 he was nominated for Oxford Professor of Poetry, and has since received honorary doctorates from several English universities, but famously refused to accept a nomination for an OBE in 2003. He was voted Britain&#39;s third favourite poet of all time (after T.S. Eliot and John Donne) in a BBC poll in 2009. In 2011 he was poet-in-residence at Keats House in 2011, and then made a radical career change by taking up his first ever academic position as a chair in Creative Writing at Brunel University in West London.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	He has appeared in a number of television programmes, including <em>Eastenders, The Bill, Live and Kicking, Blue Peter</em> and <em>Wise Up</em>, and played Gower in a BBC Radio 3 production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Pericles</em> in 2005.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Best known for his performance poetry with a political edge for adults &ndash; and his poetry with attitude for children &ndash; he has his own rap/reggae band. He has produced numerous recordings, including <em>Dub Ranting</em> (1982), <em>Rasta</em> (1983), <em>Us and Dem</em> (1990), <em>Back to Roots</em> (1995), <em>Belly of de Beast</em> (1996) and <em>Naked</em> (2004). He was the first person to record with the Wailers after the death of Bob Marley, in a musical tribute to Nelson Mandela, which Mandela heard while in prison on Robben Island. Their later meetings led to Zephaniah working with children in South African townships and hosting the President&rsquo;s Two Nations Concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1996.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	His first book of poems, <em>Pen Rhythm</em>, was produced in 1980 by a small East London publishing cooperative, Page One Books. His second collection, <em>The Dread Affair</em>, was published by Hutchinson&rsquo;s short-lived Arena imprint in 1985. He has since published three collections with Bloodaxe, <em>City Psalms</em> (1992), <em>Propa Propaganda</em> (1996) and <em>Too Black Too Strong</em> (2001), the latter including poems written while working with Michael Mansfield QC and other Tooks barristers on the Stephen Lawrence case.

He was called &lsquo;the godfather of the new poetry&rsquo; because his politically edgy, cuttingly colloquial, muscular poetry influenced a whole generation of younger British poets, from Simon Armitage to Carol Ann Duffy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Ken Smith was born in Rudston, East Yorkshire, the son of an itinerant farm labourer. He worked in Britain and America as a teacher, freelance writer, barman, magazine editor, potato picker, BBC reader and creative writing fellow, and was writer-in-residence at Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1985-87. He received America&rsquo;s highly prestigious Lannan Literary Award for Poetry in 1997, and a Cholmondeley Award in 1998.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Ken Smith was the first poet to be published by Bloodaxe, with his pamphlet <i>Tristan Crazy</i> in 1978. Smith&rsquo;s first book, <i>The Pity</i>, was published by Jonathan Cape in 1967, and his second, <i>Work, distances/poems</i>, by Swallow Press, Chicago, in 1972. His early books span a transition from his preoccupation with land and myth (when he lived in Yorkshire, Devon and America) to his later engagement with urban Britain and the politics of radical disaffection (when he lived in East London). <i>The Poet Reclining: Selected Poems 1962-1980</i> (Bloodaxe, 1982; reissued 1989) covers the first half of his writing career.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	In 1986 Ken Smith&rsquo;s collection <i>Terra</i> was shortlisted for the Whitbread Award. In 1987 Bloodaxe published his collected prose, <i>A Book of Chinese Whispers</i>. Four of his collections, <i>Terra</i> (1986), <i>Wormwood</i> (1987), <i>The heart, the border</i> (1990) and <i>Tender to the Queen of Spain</i> (1993), were Poetry Book Society Recommendations. His last separate collection, <i>Wild Root</i> (1998), a Poetry Book Society Choice, was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize. All these collections are included in his second Bloodaxe compilation, <i>Shed: Poems 1980-2001</i> (2002), the sequel to <i>The Poet Reclining.</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	In 1989 Harrap published <i>Inside Time</i>, Ken Smith&rsquo;s book about imprisonment, about Wormwood Scrubs and the men he met there. This was published in paperback by Mandarin in 1990. Ken Smith was working in Berlin when the Wall came down, writing a book about East and West Berlin: this turned into <i>Berlin: Coming in from the Cold</i> (Hamish Hamilton, 1990; Penguin paperback, 1991. He edited <i>Klaonica: poems for Bosnia</i> (Bloodaxe Books, 1993) with Judi Benson, and with Matthew Sweeney co-edited <i>Beyond Bedlam</i> (Anvil Press Poetry, 1997), a book of poems by mentally ill people.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	He died on 27 June 2003 from a hospital infection caught while being treated for Legionnaires&rsquo; Disease, which he had contracted months earlier in Cuba. His last poems are published in <i>You Again: last poems &amp; other words</i> (Bloodaxe Books, 2004) along with other uncollected work, tributes from other poets, photographs, a biographical portrait and interviews covering the whole range of his life and work.</p>', 'language,place,myth', ''),
