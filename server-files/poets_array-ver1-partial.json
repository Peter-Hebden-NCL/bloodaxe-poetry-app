She was able to publish some work during the war, but in 1946 she again came under attack, this time from Zhdanov, who denounced her with Pasternak and others for trying to &lsquo;poison the minds&rsquo; of Soviet youth.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese were attacks on her <em>published<\/em> work.

Acknowledged since the 1930s as a major figure in Modernist poetry, first by Pound and Zukofsky and later by younger writers, the Northumbrian master poet had to wait over 30 years before his genius was finally recognised in Britain - in 1966, with the publication of <em>Briggflatts,<\/em> which Cyril Connolly called &#39;the finest long poem to have been published in England since T.S. Eliot&#39;s <em>Four Quartets<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBorn in Northumberland in 1900, Bunting lived in Paris in the 20s, where Ezra Pound rescued him from jail and fixed him up with a job on the <em>Transatlantic Review<\/em>. He later followed Pound to Italy - giving up his job to Hemingway - where Yeats knew him as &#39;one of Pound&#39;s more savage disciples&#39;. For the next 30 years he led a sometimes wild and always varied life - in Italy, England, Berlin, Tenerife, America and Persia - as a struggling, penniless writer, a music critic, sea captain, RAF officer, <em>Times<\/em> correspondent and Chief of Political Intelligence in Tehran. During these years he built up a reputation in America as the best English poet of his generation, at the same time as his poetry was neglected in Britain. In 1954 he returned to Northumberland, and worked for several years as a sub-editor on the Newcastle <em>Evening Chronicle<\/em>. It was not until the publication of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> that his genius was finally recognised. He died in 1985.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Complete Poems<\/em> (2000) was reissued by Bloodaxe for Bunting&#39;s centenary and includes his original <em>Collected Poems<\/em> alongside the posthumous <em>Uncollected Poems<\/em>. It also contains a new introduction by Richard Caddel.&nbsp;The separate Bloodaxe edition of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> (2009) includes a CD with an audio recording Bunting made of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> in 1967 and a DVD of Peter Bell&rsquo;s 1982 film portrait of Bunting. As well as his own notes to the poem, the book includes his seminal essay on sound and meaning in poetry, &lsquo;The Poet&rsquo;s Point of View&rsquo; (1966). Released in June 2016 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first publication of <em>Briggflatts<\/em>, the enhanced ebook with audio of <em>Complete Poems<\/em> includes audio files of all of Bunting&#39;s major works, while the enhanced ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> includes audio files of two different readings by Bunting (1967 and 1977) together with a video of Peter Bell&#39;s film portrait.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following books are useful guides to Bunting&#39;s life and work: Keith Aldritt:&nbsp;<em>The Poet as Spy: The Life and Wild Times of Basil Bunting<\/em>&nbsp;(Aurum Press, 1999); Richard Caddel &amp; Anthony Flowers:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: A Northern Life<\/em>&nbsp;(Newcastle Libraries and Information Service \/ Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1997); Victoria Forde:&nbsp;<em>The Poetry of Basil Bunting<\/em>&nbsp;(Bloodaxe Books, 1991); Peter Makin:&nbsp;<em>Bunting: The Shaping of his Verse<\/em>&nbsp;(Clarendon Press, 1992); Peter Quartermain:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: Poet of the North<\/em>&nbsp;(Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1990); Richard Burton: <em>A Strong Song Tows Us: The Life of Basil Bunting<\/em> (2013). Selections of Bunting&#39;s prose are available in&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting on Poetry<\/em>, ed. Peter Makin (John Hopkins University Press, 2000).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloodaxe first published Bunting in 1980 when one of the earliest titles was an LP record of Bunting reading&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts<\/em>&nbsp;in 1977 accompanied in one section of the poem by a Scarlatti sonata. That recording is now being reissued on the ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts<\/em>, together with the 1967 audio recording released on cassette by Bloodaxe in 2000 and then included on the CD included with the 2007 <em>Briggflatts<\/em> edition. in 1991 Bloodaxe published the first major critical study of Bunting&#39;s work by Sister Victoria Forde. During his last years, Bunting lived at Tarset in Northumberland, just down the valley from where Bloodaxe Books was located for 15 years. Bloodaxe is named after Eric Bloodaxe, the last king of independent Northumbria, who features in&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts<\/em>&nbsp;as Bunting&#39;s opposite persona to the Cuthbert side of his Northumbrian identity.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloodaxe has sublicensed a critical edition of Bunting&rsquo;s complete poetry, <em>The Poems<\/em>, edited by Don Share (2016), to Faber &amp; Faber.

His later poetry is more personal, open and relaxed, often reflecting his broad interests: travel, music, painting, archaeology and natural sciences.<\/p> <p> \tHe was Scandinavia&rsquo;s best-known and most influential contemporary poet. His books sell thousands of copies in Sweden, and his work has been translated into over 50 languages, with substantial or complete editions of his work published in over 20 languages. <\/p> <p> \tTranstr&ouml;mer started writing poetry while at the oppressive S&ouml;dra Latin Grammar School (its atmosphere caught by Ingmar Bergman in Alf Sj&ouml;berg&rsquo;s <em>Frenzy<\/em>, which was filmed there, the young Tomas amongst the pupils). But he was devouring books on all subjects, especially geography, with daily visits to the local library, where he worked his way through most of the non-fiction shelves. However, this bookish adolescence was shadowed by the war, by his parents&rsquo; divorce and the absence of his father, and at 15 he experienced a winter of psychological crisis. He published his first collection, <em>17 Poems<\/em>, in 1954, at the age of 23.<\/p> <p> \tAfter studying psychology at the University of Stockholm, he worked at its Psychotechnological Institute, and in 1960 became a psychologist at Roxtuna, a young offenders institution. From the mid-1960s he divided his time between his writing and his work as a psychologist, and in 1965 moved with his family to V&auml;ster&aring;s, where he spent the rest of his working life. In 1990, a year after the publication of his tenth book of poems, Transtr&ouml;mer suffered a stroke, which deprived him of most of his speech and partly inhibited movement on his right-hand side. Swedish composers have since written several left-hand piano pieces especially for him to play.<\/p> <p> \tAfter his stroke, he published a short book of &#39;autobiographical chapters&#39;, <em>Memories Look at Me<\/em> (1993) and a new collection, <em>The Sad Gondola <\/em> (1996), both included in Robin Fulton&rsquo;s translation of his Bloodaxe <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> (1997). In 2004 he published <em>The Great Enigma<\/em>, a slim volume containing five short poems and a group of 45 even smaller haiku-type poems. These were added to the <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> to form Transtr&ouml;mer&rsquo;s first collected edition to appear in the States, licensed by Bloodaxe Books to New Directions in 2006 under the title <em>The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems.<\/em> That edition was published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK as the latest revised and expanded edition of <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> in 2010.&nbsp;<\/p> <p> \tTranstr&ouml;mer also translated other poets into Swedish, including Robert Bly and Hungary&rsquo;s J&aacute;nos Pilinszky. Before winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2011, he had won many other international awards for his poetry, including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in the US, the Bonner Award for Poetry, Germany&rsquo;s Petrarch Prize, the Bellman Prize, the Swedish Academy&rsquo;s Nordic Prize, and the August Prize. In 1997 the city of V&auml;ster&aring;s established a special Transtr&ouml;mer Prize.
