    "bio":"<p>Fleur Adcock writes about men and women, childhood, identity, roots and rootlessness, memory and loss, animals and dreams, as well as our interactions with nature and place. Her poised, ironic poems are remarkable for their wry wit, conversational tone and psychological insight, unmasking the deceptions of love or unravelling family lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Born in New Zealand in 1934, she spent the war years in England, returning with her family to New Zealand in 1947. She emigrated to Britain in 1963, working as a librarian in London until 1979. In 1977-78 she was writer-in-residence at Charlotte Mason College of Education, Ambleside. She was Northern Arts Literary Fellow in 1979-81, living in Newcastle, becoming a freelance writer after her return to London. She received an OBE in 1996, and the Queen&rsquo;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 2006 for <em>Poems 1960-2000<\/em> (Bloodaxe Books, 2000).<\/p>\r\n<p>Fleur Adcock published three pamphlets with Bloodaxe: <em>Below Loughrigg<\/em> (1979), <em>Hotspur<\/em> (1986) and <em>Meeting the Comet<\/em> (1988), as well as her translations of medieval Latin lyrics, <em>The Virgin &amp; the Nightingale<\/em> (1983).

    "bio":" <p>\r\n\tAnna Akhmatova (1889-1966) was Russia&rsquo;s greatest modern poet. She published her first book of poems in 1912, and in the same year founded the Acmeist movement with her husband, the poet Gumilev. Her intense, highly personal love lyrics were later attacked as anti-revolutionary, and in 1925 her poetry was banned.<\/p>\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tGumilev was shot in 1921 for alleged involvement in an anti-Bolshevik plot, and in the years of terror which followed under Stalin, Akhmatova was persecuted for her work along with fellow poets Mandelstam, who died in a camp, and Tsvetaeva, who committed suicide. She was able to publish some work during the war, but in 1946 she again came under attack, this time from Zhdanov, who denounced her with Pasternak and others for trying to &lsquo;poison the minds&rsquo; of Soviet youth.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese were attacks on her <em>published<\/em> work. What she was writing &ndash; but could not publish &ndash; was far more dangerous. For she had entered her years of silence. As she fought for her son&rsquo;s release from prison, she was writing her greatest poetry: the cycle <em>Requiem<\/em>, which commemorated all of Stalin&rsquo;s victims, and Poem without a hero, which she began in 1940 and worked on for over 20 years.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll she wrote she committed to memory. Several trusted friends also memorised her poems, among them Mandelstam&rsquo;s widow Nadezhda. She wrote nothing down, and so survived, the people&rsquo;s conscience, the one who kept &#39;the great Russian word&#39; alive. <\/p>",

It rises,&nbsp;<\/p><p>slides its greasy back against the fencing slats, unfocuses the garden in a haar<\/p><p>of smoke. Beyond the helpless trees somewhere a dog rattles awake; the air brake<\/p><p>of a distant night bus seethes.

All she can think of, crouching down for air the way she learned&nbsp;<\/p><p>in school, is all those times she filled out mental lists of things she&rsquo;d save from Fire.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The photographs, the diaries, the cat she thought she&rsquo;d buy but never found or named.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>And then the street&rsquo;s a discoth&egrave;que of blue and red, the neighbours on their front steps&nbsp;<\/p><p>in their dressing gowns, the kids agape behind the nets.&nbsp;<\/p><p>And she wants none of it.&nbsp;<\/p><p>And Fire takes it all.<\/p>",

    "bio":"<p>\r\n\tBasil Bunting was one of the most important British poets of the 20th century. Acknowledged since the 1930s as a major figure in Modernist poetry, first by Pound and Zukofsky and later by younger writers, the Northumbrian master poet had to wait over 30 years before his genius was finally recognised in Britain - in 1966, with the publication of <em>Briggflatts,<\/em> which Cyril Connolly called &#39;the finest long poem to have been published in England since T.S. Eliot&#39;s <em>Four Quartets<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBorn in Northumberland in 1900, Bunting lived in Paris in the 20s, where Ezra Pound rescued him from jail and fixed him up with a job on the <em>Transatlantic Review<\/em>. He later followed Pound to Italy - giving up his job to Hemingway - where Yeats knew him as &#39;one of Pound&#39;s more savage disciples&#39;. For the next 30 years he led a sometimes wild and always varied life - in Italy, England, Berlin, Tenerife, America and Persia - as a struggling, penniless writer, a music critic, sea captain, RAF officer, <em>Times<\/em> correspondent and Chief of Political Intelligence in Tehran. During these years he built up a reputation in America as the best English poet of his generation, at the same time as his poetry was neglected in Britain. In 1954 he returned to Northumberland, and worked for several years as a sub-editor on the Newcastle <em>Evening Chronicle<\/em>. It was not until the publication of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> that his genius was finally recognised. He died in 1985.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Complete Poems<\/em> (2000) was reissued by Bloodaxe for Bunting&#39;s centenary and includes his original <em>Collected Poems<\/em> alongside the posthumous <em>Uncollected Poems<\/em>. It also contains a new introduction by Richard Caddel.&nbsp;The separate Bloodaxe edition of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> (2009) includes a CD with an audio recording Bunting made of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> in 1967 and a DVD of Peter Bell&rsquo;s 1982 film portrait of Bunting. As well as his own notes to the poem, the book includes his seminal essay on sound and meaning in poetry, &lsquo;The Poet&rsquo;s Point of View&rsquo; (1966). Released in June 2016 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first publication of <em>Briggflatts<\/em>, the enhanced ebook with audio of <em>Complete Poems<\/em> includes audio files of all of Bunting&#39;s major works, while the enhanced ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts<\/em> includes audio files of two different readings by Bunting (1967 and 1977) together with a video of Peter Bell&#39;s film portrait.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following books are useful guides to Bunting&#39;s life and work: Keith Aldritt:&nbsp;<em>The Poet as Spy: The Life and Wild Times of Basil Bunting<\/em>&nbsp;(Aurum Press, 1999); Richard Caddel &amp; Anthony Flowers:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: A Northern Life<\/em>&nbsp;(Newcastle Libraries and Information Service \/ Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1997); Victoria Forde:&nbsp;<em>The Poetry of Basil Bunting<\/em>&nbsp;(Bloodaxe Books, 1991); Peter Makin:&nbsp;<em>Bunting: The Shaping of his Verse<\/em>&nbsp;(Clarendon Press, 1992); Peter Quartermain:&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting: Poet of the North<\/em>&nbsp;(Basil Bunting Poetry Centre, 1990); Richard Burton: <em>A Strong Song Tows Us: The Life of Basil Bunting<\/em> (2013). Selections of Bunting&#39;s prose are available in&nbsp;<em>Basil Bunting on Poetry<\/em>, ed. Peter Makin (John Hopkins University Press, 2000).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloodaxe first published Bunting in 1980 when one of the earliest titles was an LP record of Bunting reading&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts<\/em>&nbsp;in 1977 accompanied in one section of the poem by a Scarlatti sonata. That recording is now being reissued on the ebook with audio and video of <em>Briggflatts<\/em>, together with the 1967 audio recording released on cassette by Bloodaxe in 2000 and then included on the CD included with the 2007 <em>Briggflatts<\/em> edition. in 1991 Bloodaxe published the first major critical study of Bunting&#39;s work by Sister Victoria Forde. During his last years, Bunting lived at Tarset in Northumberland, just down the valley from where Bloodaxe Books was located for 15 years. Bloodaxe is named after Eric Bloodaxe, the last king of independent Northumbria, who features in&nbsp;<em>Briggflatts<\/em>&nbsp;as Bunting&#39;s opposite persona to the Cuthbert side of his Northumbrian identity.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloodaxe has sublicensed a critical edition of Bunting&rsquo;s complete poetry, <em>The Poems<\/em>, edited by Don Share (2016), to Faber &amp; Faber. This has three poems not included in the Bloodaxe edition, together with a number of variants, anomalies, fragments and &quot;false starts&quot;: apart from those additions, Bloodaxe&#39;s <em>Complete Poems<\/em> is complete (but has no critical apparatus).<\/p>",

    "bio":" <p>Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer (1931-2015) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2011.<\/p> <p> \tHe was born in Stockholm, where he grew up, but spent many long summers on the island of Runmar&ouml; in the nearby archipelago, evoking that landscape in his early work, which draws on the aesthetic tradition of Swedish nature poetry. His later poetry is more personal, open and relaxed, often reflecting his broad interests: travel, music, painting, archaeology and natural sciences.<\/p> <p> \tHe was Scandinavia&rsquo;s best-known and most influential contemporary poet. His books sell thousands of copies in Sweden, and his work has been translated into over 50 languages, with substantial or complete editions of his work published in over 20 languages. <\/p> <p> \tTranstr&ouml;mer started writing poetry while at the oppressive S&ouml;dra Latin Grammar School (its atmosphere caught by Ingmar Bergman in Alf Sj&ouml;berg&rsquo;s <em>Frenzy<\/em>, which was filmed there, the young Tomas amongst the pupils). But he was devouring books on all subjects, especially geography, with daily visits to the local library, where he worked his way through most of the non-fiction shelves. However, this bookish adolescence was shadowed by the war, by his parents&rsquo; divorce and the absence of his father, and at 15 he experienced a winter of psychological crisis. He published his first collection, <em>17 Poems<\/em>, in 1954, at the age of 23.<\/p> <p> \tAfter studying psychology at the University of Stockholm, he worked at its Psychotechnological Institute, and in 1960 became a psychologist at Roxtuna, a young offenders institution. From the mid-1960s he divided his time between his writing and his work as a psychologist, and in 1965 moved with his family to V&auml;ster&aring;s, where he spent the rest of his working life. In 1990, a year after the publication of his tenth book of poems, Transtr&ouml;mer suffered a stroke, which deprived him of most of his speech and partly inhibited movement on his right-hand side. Swedish composers have since written several left-hand piano pieces especially for him to play.<\/p> <p> \tAfter his stroke, he published a short book of &#39;autobiographical chapters&#39;, <em>Memories Look at Me<\/em> (1993) and a new collection, <em>The Sad Gondola <\/em> (1996), both included in Robin Fulton&rsquo;s translation of his Bloodaxe <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> (1997). In 2004 he published <em>The Great Enigma<\/em>, a slim volume containing five short poems and a group of 45 even smaller haiku-type poems. These were added to the <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> to form Transtr&ouml;mer&rsquo;s first collected edition to appear in the States, licensed by Bloodaxe Books to New Directions in 2006 under the title <em>The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems.<\/em> That edition was published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK as the latest revised and expanded edition of <em>New Collected Poems<\/em> in 2010.&nbsp;<\/p> <p> \tTranstr&ouml;mer also translated other poets into Swedish, including Robert Bly and Hungary&rsquo;s J&aacute;nos Pilinszky. Before winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2011, he had won many other international awards for his poetry, including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in the US, the Bonner Award for Poetry, Germany&rsquo;s Petrarch Prize, the Bellman Prize, the Swedish Academy&rsquo;s Nordic Prize, and the August Prize. In 1997 the city of V&auml;ster&aring;s established a special Transtr&ouml;mer Prize. In 2007, he received a special Lifetime Recognition Award given by the trustees of the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry, which also awards the annual Griffin Poetry Prize.<\/p> <p> \tHis correspondence with Robert Bly was published in Sweden in 2001, and in 2013 an English translation, <em>Airmail: The Letters of Robert Bly and Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer<\/em>, was published by Bloodaxe Books in the UK and by Graywolf Press in the US.<\/p>",

    "bio":"<p>\r\n\tBenjamin Zephaniah is an oral poet, novelist, playwright, children&rsquo;s writer and reggae artist. Born in 1958 in Birmingham, he grew up in Handsworth, where he was sent to an approved school for being uncontrollable, rebellious and &lsquo;a born failure&rsquo;, ending up in jail for burglary and affray.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter prison he turned from crime to music and poetry. In 1989 he was nominated for Oxford Professor of Poetry, and has since received honorary doctorates from several English universities, but famously refused to accept a nomination for an OBE in 2003. He was voted Britain&#39;s third favourite poet of all time (after T.S. Eliot and John Donne) in a BBC poll in 2009. In 2011 he was poet-in-residence at Keats House in 2011, and then made a radical career change by taking up his first ever academic position as a chair in Creative Writing at Brunel University in West London.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe has appeared in a number of television programmes, including <em>Eastenders, The Bill, Live and Kicking, Blue Peter<\/em> and <em>Wise Up<\/em>, and played Gower in a BBC Radio 3 production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Pericles<\/em> in 2005.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBest known for his performance poetry with a political edge for adults &ndash; and his poetry with attitude for children &ndash; he has his own rap\/reggae band. He has produced numerous recordings, including <em>Dub Ranting<\/em> (1982), <em>Rasta<\/em> (1983), <em>Us and Dem<\/em> (1990), <em>Back to Roots<\/em> (1995), <em>Belly of de Beast<\/em> (1996) and <em>Naked<\/em> (2004). He was the first person to record with the Wailers after the death of Bob Marley, in a musical tribute to Nelson Mandela, which Mandela heard while in prison on Robben Island. Their later meetings led to Zephaniah working with children in South African townships and hosting the President&rsquo;s Two Nations Concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1996.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis first book of poems, <em>Pen Rhythm<\/em>, was produced in 1980 by a small East London publishing cooperative, Page One Books. His second collection, <em>The Dread Affair<\/em>, was published by Hutchinson&rsquo;s short-lived Arena imprint in 1985. He has since published three collections with Bloodaxe, <em>City Psalms<\/em> (1992), <em>Propa Propaganda<\/em> (1996) and <em>Too Black Too Strong<\/em> (2001), the latter including poems written while working with Michael Mansfield QC and other Tooks barristers on the Stephen Lawrence case. His DVD-book <em>To Do Wid Me: Benjamin Zephaniah live and direct<\/em> (filmed by Pamela Robertson-Pearce) is out from Bloodaxe Books in 2013.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis other titles include his poetry books for children, <em>Talking Turkeys<\/em> (1994), <em>Funky Chickens<\/em> (1996) and <em>Wicked World<\/em> (2000), all from Puffin\/Penguin; his novels for teenagers, <em>Face<\/em> (1999), <em>Refugee Boy<\/em> (2001), <em>Gangsta Rap<\/em> (2004) and <em>Teacher&rsquo;s Dead<\/em> (2007), all from Bloomsbury; <em>The Bloomsbury Book of Love Poems<\/em> (1999); <em>Schools Out: Poems Not for School<\/em> (1997) and <em>The Little Book of Vegan Poems<\/em> (2001) from AK Press; and <em>We Are Britain<\/em> (Frances Lincoln, 2003).<\/p>",

Kerry, he was Professor of Modern Literature at Trinity College, Dublin for over 30 years, and retired from teaching in 2005. He now lives in Listowel, Co. Kerry.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe has published more than 30 books of poetry, including <i>Familiar Strangers: New &amp; Selected Poems 1960-2004<\/i> (2004), which includes the whole of his book-length poem <i>The Man Made of Rain<\/i> (1998). He is best-known for two controversial poetry books, <i>Cromwell<\/i>, published in Ireland in 1983 and in Britain by Bloodaxe in 1987, and his epic poem <i>The Book of Judas<\/i> (1991), which topped the Irish bestsellers list: a shorter version was published by Bloodaxe in 2002 as <i>The Little Book of Judas<\/i>. His third epic, <i>Poetry My Arse<\/i> (1995), did much to outdo these in notoriety. All these remain available separately from Bloodaxe, along with his more recent titles: <i>Glimpses<\/i> (2001), <i>Martial Art<\/i> (2003), <i>Now<\/i> (2006), <i>Reservoir Voices<\/i> (2009), <i>The Essential Brendan Kennelly: Selected Poems<\/i>, edited by Terence Brown and Michael Longley, with audio CD (2011), and <i>Guff<\/i> (2013).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis drama titles include <i>When Then Is Now<\/i> (2006), a trilogy of his modern versions of three Greek tragedies (all previously published by Bloodaxe): Sophocles&rsquo; <i>Antigone<\/i> and Euripides&rsquo; <i>Medea<\/i> and <i>The Trojan Women<\/i>. His <i>Antigone<\/i> and <i>The Trojan Women<\/i> were both first performed at the Peacock Theatre, Dublin, in 1986 and 1993 respectively; <i>Medea<\/i> premi&egrave;red in the Dublin Theatre Festival in 1988, toured in England in 1989 and was broadcast by BBC Radio 3. His other plays include Lorca&rsquo;s <i>Blood Wedding<\/i> (Northern Stage, Newcastle &amp; Bloodaxe, 1996).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis translations of Irish poetry are available in <i>Love of Ireland: Poems from the Irish<\/i> (Mercier Press, 1989). He has edited several anthologies, including <i>The Penguin Book of Irish Verse<\/i> (1970\/1981), <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Women: Writings Past and Present<\/i>, with Katie Donovan and A. Norman Jeffares (Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994), and <i>Dublines<\/i>, with Katie Donovan (Bloodaxe Books, 1995), and published two early novels, <i>The Crooked Cross<\/i> (1963) and <i>The Florentines<\/i> (1967).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis<i> Journey into Joy: Selected Prose<\/i>, edited by &Aring;ke Persson, was published by Bloodaxe in 1994, along with <i>Dark Fathers into Light<\/i>, a critical anthology on his work edited by Richard Pine.

    "bio":"<p>\r\n\tKen Smith (1938-2003) was a major voice in world poetry, a writer whose work shifted territory with time, from land to city, from Yorkshire, America and London to war-ravaged Eastern Europe. He was called &lsquo;the godfather of the new poetry&rsquo; because his politically edgy, cuttingly colloquial, muscular poetry influenced a whole generation of younger British poets, from Simon Armitage to Carol Ann Duffy.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKen Smith was born in Rudston, East Yorkshire, the son of an itinerant farm labourer. He worked in Britain and America as a teacher, freelance writer, barman, magazine editor, potato picker, BBC reader and creative writing fellow, and was writer-in-residence at Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1985-87. He received America&rsquo;s highly prestigious Lannan Literary Award for Poetry in 1997, and a Cholmondeley Award in 1998.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKen Smith was the first poet to be published by Bloodaxe, with his pamphlet <i>Tristan Crazy<\/i> in 1978. Smith&rsquo;s first book, <i>The Pity<\/i>, was published by Jonathan Cape in 1967, and his second, <i>Work, distances\/poems<\/i>, by Swallow Press, Chicago, in 1972. His early books span a transition from his preoccupation with land and myth (when he lived in Yorkshire, Devon and America) to his later engagement with urban Britain and the politics of radical disaffection (when he lived in East London). <i>The Poet Reclining: Selected Poems 1962-1980<\/i> (Bloodaxe, 1982; reissued 1989) covers the first half of his writing career.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1986 Ken Smith&rsquo;s collection <i>Terra<\/i> was shortlisted for the Whitbread Award. In 1987 Bloodaxe published his collected prose, <i>A Book of Chinese Whispers<\/i>. Four of his collections, <i>Terra<\/i> (1986), <i>Wormwood<\/i> (1987), <i>The heart, the border<\/i> (1990) and <i>Tender to the Queen of Spain<\/i> (1993), were Poetry Book Society Recommendations. His last separate collection, <i>Wild Root<\/i> (1998), a Poetry Book Society Choice, was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize. All these collections are included in his second Bloodaxe compilation, <i>Shed: Poems 1980-2001<\/i> (2002), the sequel to <i>The Poet Reclining.<\/i><\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1989 Harrap published <i>Inside Time<\/i>, Ken Smith&rsquo;s book about imprisonment, about Wormwood Scrubs and the men he met there. This was published in paperback by Mandarin in 1990. Ken Smith was working in Berlin when the Wall came down, writing a book about East and West Berlin: this turned into <i>Berlin: Coming in from the Cold<\/i> (Hamish Hamilton, 1990; Penguin paperback, 1991. He edited <i>Klaonica: poems for Bosnia<\/i> (Bloodaxe Books, 1993) with Judi Benson, and with Matthew Sweeney co-edited <i>Beyond Bedlam<\/i> (Anvil Press Poetry, 1997), a book of poems by mentally ill people.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe died on 27 June 2003 from a hospital infection caught while being treated for Legionnaires&rsquo; Disease, which he had contracted months earlier in Cuba. His last poems are published in <i>You Again: last poems &amp; other words<\/i> (Bloodaxe Books, 2004) along with other uncollected work, tributes from other poets, photographs, a biographical portrait and interviews covering the whole range of his life and work.<\/p>",

He learnt to read before he was four years old, mostly from the Bible, which he often read aloud to his mother&rsquo;s friends. When he was 17, he went to work in America, but hated the way black people were treated there, and returned to Jamaica after four years. In 1948, he made his way to Britain, and took a job working for British Telecom.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n One of the first black writers in Britain to achieve wider recognition, Berry rose to prominence in 1981 when he won the National Poetry Competition. His numerous books include two seminal anthologies of Caribbean poetry, <i>Bluefoot Traveller <\/i>(1976) and <i>News for Babylon <\/i>(Chatto, 1984). His retrospective, <i>A Story I Am In: Selected Poems<\/i> (Bloodaxe Books, 2011), draws on five collections of poetry, including <i>Fractured Circles<\/i> (1979) and <i>Lucy&rsquo;s Letters and Loving<\/i> (1982) from New Beacon Books, <i>Chain of Days<\/i> (Oxford University Press, 1985), and <i>Hot Earth Cold Earth<\/i> (1995) and <i>Windrush Songs<\/i> (2007) from Bloodaxe. <i>Windrush Songs<\/i> was published to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade. <\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n He also published several books of poetry and short stories for children (from Hamish Hamilton, Puffin and Walker Books), and won many literary prizes, including the Smarties Prize (1987), the Signal Poetry Award (1989) and a Cholmondeley Award (1991).

There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English. Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man\u2019s legs or cut his hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck themselves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground. <\/p>\r\n<p class='prose-style'>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class='prose-style'>May 1978<\/p>",

In 1959, after her husband committed suicide, she had to raise three daughters alone, all the time writing what she called her &lsquo;love poems, all written to a dead man&rsquo; who forced her to &lsquo;reside in limbo&rsquo; with her daughters. For 20 years she travelled the US, teaching creative writing at many universities. A greatly loved teacher, she was still working into her 80s. She won many awards and honours, including the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Eric Mathieu King Award from the Academy of American Poets, a Whiting Award (with which she bought plumbing for her house), two Guggenheim Fellowships (one of which roofed the house), the Delmore Schwartz Award, the Cerf Lifetime Achievement Award from the state of Vermont, and the Shelley Memorial Award. Her retrospective <i>What Love Comes To: New &amp; Selected Poems<\/i> was published in 2008 in the US by Copper Canyon and in the UK by Bloodaxe Books and was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation.

    "bio":"<p>\r\n Doris Kareva is one of Estonia&rsquo;s leading poets. She was born in Tallinn in 1958, daughter of the composer Hillar Kareva, and published her first poems at the age of 14. In 1977 she entered the University of Tartu as an already acknowledged young poet. Due to her dissident connections she was expelled but graduated as a distance student in Romance and Germanic philology. She has worked for the cultural weekly <em>Sirp<\/em> (Sickle) and as the Secretary-General of the Estonian National Commission for UNESCO from 1992 to 2008, and is currently an editor for the literary journal <em>Looming <\/em>(Creation).<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n Following the restoration of Estonian independence, Kareva&rsquo;s collection <em>In Place of the World<\/em> received the national cultural prize in 1993. She used the prize money to set up the &lsquo;Straw Stipend&rsquo; for the publication of debut collections, to support emerging talent in unsettled times. Kareva has published 15 collections of poetry, a collection of essays and a work of prose. She has also translated poetry (Anna Akhmatova, Emily Bront&euml;, Emily Dickinson, Kabir, Rumi) and plays, essays and prose (W.H. Auden, Samuel Beckett, Joseph Brodsky, Kahlil Gibran, Shakespeare). She has compiled anthologies, written texts for music and theatre, and given lectures on culture, education and ethics in Estonia and abroad. Her poetry has been translated into over 20 languages and has inspired composers and directors in Estonia and abroad &ndash; sounding equally fitting at a punk concert and the funeral ceremony of a president, in a Warner Classics studio and at the Estonian Song Festival. Kareva has been honoured with two national cultural prizes and four literary prizes; in 2001 she was awarded the Estonian Order of the White Star.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n She has two books of poetry in English translation, <em>Shape of Time<\/em>, translated by Tiina Aleman (Arc Publications, 2010), and <em>Days of Grace: Selected Poems<\/em>, translated by Miriam McIlfatrick-Ksenofontov (Bloodaxe Books, 2018).<\/p>",

    "bio":"<p>\r\n Macedonian poet, editor, essayist and translator Nikola&nbsp;Madzirov was born in Strumica in 1973 to a family of Balkan War refugees, and grew up in the Soviet era in the former Republic of Yugoslavia ruled by Marshall Tito. He was 18 when Macedonia gained independence, and has since published several collections of poetry, including Studentski Zbor award-winner <i>Locked in the City<\/i> (1999), Aco Karamanov Award-winner <i>Somewhere Nowhere<\/i> (1999), and <i>Relocated Stone<\/i> (2007), winner of the Hubert Burda Prize for East European poets. The contemporary jazz composer and collaborator of Bj&ouml;rk and Lou Reed, Oliver Lake, has composed music based on Madzirov&#39;s poems. His work has been translated into more than thirty languages. The first translation of his poetry into English was <i>Remnants of Another Age<\/i>, translated by Peggy Reid, Graham Reid, Magdalena Horvat and Adam Reed, and published with a foreword by Carolyn Forch&eacute; by BOA Editions in the US in 2011 and by Bloodaxe Books in the UK in 2013. A German edition, <i>Versetzter Stein<\/i>, translated by Alexander Sitzmann, was published by Hanser Verlag in 2011.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n He has taken part in many literature festivals, including Poetry Parnassus at London&#39;s Southbank Centre in 2012, and has received several international awards and fellowships, including the DJS award for contemporary world poetry in China, International Writing Program at the University of Iowa and Literarisches Tandem in Berlin. His other honours include the Marguerite Yourcenar fellowship, the Miladinov Brothers poetry prize (Struga Poetry Evenings) and residencies at KulturKontakt in Vienna, LCB in Berlin and Villa Waldberta in Munich. He is one of the coordinators of the international poetry network for Lyrikline.<\/p>",

    "bio":"<p>\r\n Jaan Kaplinski is one of Estonia&#39;s best-known writers and cultural figures. He was born in Tartu in 1941, shortly after the Soviet annexation of Estonia. His mother was Estonian, and his Polish father died in a labour camp in northern Russia when Jaan was still a child. &lsquo;My childhood,&rsquo; he has said, &lsquo;passed in Tartu, a war-devastated university town. It was a time of repression, fear and poverty.&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n Jaan Kaplinski studied Romance Language and Linguistics at Tartu University and has worked as a researcher in linguistics, as a sociologist, ecologist and translator. He has lectured on the History of Western Civilisation at Tartu University and has been a student of Mahayana Buddhism and philosophies of the Far East. He has published several books of poetry and essays in Estonian, Finnish and English, and his work has been translated into Norwegian, Swedish, Latvian, Russian and Czech.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n After publishing translations of three collections with Harvill in Britain, one of these from Breitenbush and one from Copper Canyon in the US, Kaplinski published <i>Evening Brings Everything Back<\/i> with Bloodaxe Books in 2004, a book combining work from three earlier titles published in Estonia, <i>Evening brings everything back<\/i> (1984), <i>Ice and Heather<\/i> (1989) and <i>Summers and Springs<\/i> (1995). His semi-autobiographical novel, <i>The Same River<\/i>, translated by Susan Wilson, was published by Peter Owen in 2009.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n His <i>Selected Poems<\/i> (Bloodaxe Books, 2011) includes work previously unpublished in English as well as poems drawn from all four of his previous UK collections: <i>The Same Sea in Us All<\/i> (1985\/1990), <i>The Wandering Border<\/i> (1987\/1992), <i>Through the Forest<\/i> (1991\/1996) and <i>Evening Brings Everything Back<\/i> (2004). He was awarded the European Prize for Literature in 2016.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n He has translated poetry from French, English, Spanish, Chinese and Swedish (a book of poems by Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer), and travelled in many countries, including Britain, China, Turkey and parts of Russia. Awarded many prizes and honours, he is a member of several learned societies including the Universal Academy of Cultures, and has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Jaan Kaplinski was a member of the new post-Revolution Estonian parliament (Riigikogu) in 1992-95 and his essays on cultural transition and the challenges of globalisation are published across the Baltic region.
